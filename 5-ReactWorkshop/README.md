# React Workshop

This folder contains code from 6 hours **React Workshop** in this workshop we use **ES5 base syntax** (like `React.createClass()`) so if you don't familiar with ES6 this is a good start because you will learn a basic concept of React (like props, state) with a simple JavaScript.

**Note:** In workshop we using ES5 syntax but some of my code using ES6 because it's more convenient (like Object destructuring to get props properties). 

## Workshop topic coverage
- Render React component via `ReactDOM.render()`
- Create React component via `React.createClass()`
- `props` and `state` and some of `refs`
